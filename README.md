# 🧩 Small & Leisure Projects

Welcome! This repository is a collection of my small, fun, and sometimes spontaneous coding projects. These are simple builds that can be done in one sitting—whether it's to learn something new, test an idea, or just relax with some light coding.

---

## 📌 What You'll Find Here

- 💡 Mini tools and scripts
- 🎨 Basic front-end layouts
- ⚙️ Small utilities and functions
- 📚 Code experiments and learning snippets
- 🧪 One-off testing files

These projects are often:
- Solo-built
- Basic in scope
- Not always fully optimized or documented (but still fun!)
- Meant for exploration more than production

---

## 💻 Tech Stack (Varies Per Project)

- HTML / CSS / JavaScript  
- Sometimes a bit of Git or API play

---

## 🎯 Purpose

This is a place to:
- Practice ideas 💭
- Learn new syntax or methods 🧠
- Keep a log of random but useful creations ✨
- Just enjoy coding without pressure 💻

---

## 🤝 Contributions

This is mostly a personal sandbox, but feel free to explore, fork, or get inspired. If you have a fun idea or suggestion, I'm all ears!
